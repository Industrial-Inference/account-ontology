# account-ontology
An ontology capturing the essence of what it means to hold an account with some other party

## Motivation

The purpose of creating this ontology is to support the formation of a life
object, where a person's life data is captured in a variety of ways including
the relationships they have with other organisations.  A relationship with an
organisation, such as a utility company or a healthcare provider or even a
government, typically is formalised in the form of a contract of services.

This ontology tries to create a representation of that contract of services in a
general enough way to enable the capture of essential data about all kinds of
services, as well as making that capture intuitive, and human readable.

# account-ontology

An ontology capturing the essence of what it means to hold an account with some other party

## Motivation

The purpose of creating this ontology is to support the formation of a life
object, where a person's life data is captured in a variety of ways including
the relationships they have with other organisations.  A relationship with an
organisation, such as a utility company or a healthcare provider or even a
government, typically is formalised in the form of a contract of services.

This ontology tries to create a representation of that contract of services in a
general enough way to enable the capture of essential data about all kinds of
services, as well as making that capture intuitive, and human readable.

## Key concepts

- party, service provider, service consumer
- contract, agreement, relationship
- term, interval, period
- commitment, contractual undertaking, obligation, right, duty, permission, access to, 
- service
- service fee, recompense
- service consumption, service delivery
- service contract identifier, account number
- account, balance, credit, debit, pre/post payment
- service component, service entitlement, service offering, 
- regulation, law, constraint, contractual qualification, 

## objectives

- brevity (confined to relevant details from consumer end)
- linkage to a consistent upper ontology
- consistent representation for all types of contract and industry
- capturing temporal boundedness of relations
- providing a place to record incidents of service provision
- capture information worthy of long term retention
- provide inferences based on semantics of contracts?
